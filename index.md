## About Me

I am a third-year PhD student at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk) supervised by [Prof. Pheng-Ann Heng](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~pheng/1.html). Before that, I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/) supervised by [Prof. Bin Cui](https://cuibinpku.github.io/). 

I'm now joining [Meta](https://www.meta.com/) as a research intern. I previously worked as a research intern at [Amazon AWS AI Lab](https://www.amazon.science/), [Roblox](https://www.roblox.com/), [Tencent](https://www.tencent.com/), and [Shanghai AI Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn/).

My research interests mainly include <b><i style="color:#7b5aa6">Multi-modal Learning, Large Language/Vision Models, and 3D Vision.</i></b>

✉️ I’ll be on the job market in 2027. Happy to connect about opportunities!

📌 I'm looking for undergraduate and graduate students for academic cooperation. Discussions are welcome!
