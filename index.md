## About Me

I am a PhD student at [the Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk) supervised by [Prof. Pheng-Ann Heng](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~pheng/1.html). Before that, I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/) supervised by [Prof. Bin Cui](https://cuibinpku.github.io/). I previously worked as an intern at Tencent and Shanghai AI Laboratory, and will join [Amazon Lex](https://aws.amazon.com/lex/) as a research intern this summer.

My research interests mainly include <b><i style="color:#7b5aa6">Multi-modal Learning, Large Language Models, and 3D Vision.</i></b>
